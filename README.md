## PortMaster

PortMaster is a simple tool that allows easy installation of Ports for devices running AmberELEC, ArkOS, JelOS, RetroOZ, TheRA, and EmuELEC for various handheld linux based devices. 

One of the goals of PortMaster is to not install or upgrade any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any of the ports that need a particular non standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution.
